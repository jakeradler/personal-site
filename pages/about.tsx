        <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-4">
          I began exploring web development as a hobby during college. I attended University of Massachusetts
          Amherst and graduated with a degree in Economics. During school, I did some freelance web work and
          by that point, I was hooked!

          When I'm not coding, you can probably find me playing piano or guitar because I love listening to
          and writing music.
