        <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-4">
          I'm a 17 year old aspiring polymath, developer and inventor working in numerous industries to challenge the current status-quo of technology. I've founded 3 companies that have worked with major organizations like Mastercard and were incubated in the DMZ. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-4">
          When I'm not working I'm most likely learning about different technologies and how they interact or I'm just playing some video games.
